# MISP_tooling
Tools to work with MISP (https://www.misp-project.org/)


firstseen_lastseen.py
This program is a MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) attribute processor designed to update attributes with accurate timestamps for their first and last sightings. It streamlines the process of managing and enriching threat intelligence data by leveraging MISP's API and multithreaded processing.

Purpose
The primary goal is to ensure MISP attributes include first_seen and last_seen timestamps, improving data accuracy and value for threat intelligence analysis.

Workflow
Configuration:
The user specifies the MISP URL, API key, and attribute types to process.
Logging and error handling are set up to track progress and handle issues gracefully.

Progress Tracking:
The program reads from a progress file to resume processing from the last processed attribute.
Progress is periodically saved to avoid data loss in case of interruptions.

Attribute Processing:
Attributes are fetched from MISP in batches based on user-defined types.
For each attribute, the earliest and latest timestamps are determined by querying related occurrences.

Concurrency:
Multithreading ensures efficient processing of attributes, even with large datasets.
A mechanism is in place to manage connection pool limitations and randomize pauses in thread execution when needed.

Error Handling:
Errors during processing are logged for review without halting the entire program.
Connection issues trigger automatic retries with a delay.

Completion:
Once all attributes are processed, the program logs a completion message.
The program is highly configurable, allowing users to add or remove attribute types as needed and customize batch sizes, logging behavior, and concurrency settings. This flexibility makes it an effective tool for enriching MISP data in diverse threat intelligence workflows.

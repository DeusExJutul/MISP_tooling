firstseen_lastseen.py

Purpose and Workflow of the Script
This program is designed to efficiently process and update attributes in a MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) instance. It focuses on ensuring that the first_seen and last_seen timestamps for attributes are accurate, thereby enhancing the value of threat intelligence data.

Purpose
Attribute Enrichment:
Updates attributes in MISP with accurate first_seen and last_seen timestamps based on occurrence history.

Scalability:
Handles large datasets with a multithreaded architecture for faster processing.

Error Management:
Implements robust error logging and retries for uninterrupted operation.

Connection Pool Management:
Dynamically manages thread creation based on the connection pool's availability to avoid overload.
Workflow

Configuration:
User specifies MISP instance details, batch size, logging options, and attribute types to process.

Progress Management:
The program loads the last processed attribute ID from a progress file and resumes processing from there.
Progress is periodically saved to avoid reprocessing in case of an interruption.

Attribute Processing:
Fetches attributes from MISP in batches based on user-defined attribute types.
Determines first_seen and last_seen timestamps by querying historical occurrences of each attribute.

Concurrency:
Uses a thread pool to process attributes concurrently.
Pauses thread creation when the connection pool is full and resumes after clearing.

Error Handling:
Logs errors and skips problematic attributes while ensuring the process continues.

Completion:
Logs a completion message when all attributes are processed.
